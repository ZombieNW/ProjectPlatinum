# ProjectPlatinum

**The Final Resting Place for my Greatest Project**

## History

In 2019, I started a locally hosted "unblocked games" website for some friends of mine. As more people wanted access, the codebase grew. From 2019-2023, the codebase was pretty actively maintained. I'd find it a shame to leave it to die as a memory, so to preserve it, I am transforming it.

## What?

ProjectPlatinum is a self-hosted web emulation frontend that uses different online emulators to play your locally hosted roms. We actively discourage people from exposing this to the web for fairly obvious legal reasons. Think of this like Plex for Emulation.
